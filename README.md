**Abstract**

> Level assessment for foreign language students is necessary for putting them in the right learning group, but it is also a very
time-consuming task, so we propose to automate the evaluation of speaker fluency level by implementing machine learning
techniques. This work presents an audio processing system capable of classifying the level of fluency of non-native English
speakers using five different machine learning models. As a first step, we have built our own dataset, which consists of labeled
audio conversations in English between people ranging in different fluency domains/classes (low, intermediate, high). We
segment the audio conversations into 5s non-overlapped audio segments and thereafter perform feature extraction on them.
After this, we have tunned the appropriate number of Mel cepstral coefficients to be extracted extracted from the audios by
evaluating accuracy performance. Thereafter, we have added the zero-crossing rate, root mean square energy and spectral flux
features, proving that this improves model performance overall. Out of a total of 1424 audio segments, with 70% training data
and 30% test data, our trained models have achieved a classification accuracy as high as 94.39% (support vector machine), the
rest of our models have passed the 89% classification accuracy.
